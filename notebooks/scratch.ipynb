       "Putting Sideboard at the top for ease of access. Please read the guide below.\n",
       "# Equipment/Sideboard\n",
       "This deck utilizes a 51 card mainboard, and a sideboard that is all 3-ofs*. This means for every matchup you just choose your equipment, and what 3 playsets to board in. \n",
       "\n",
       "* **Nullrune Gloves** - Bring in against runeblade and Kano.\n",
       "* **Crown of Reflection and Nullrune Boots** - Wear these against Kano, and only against Kano. \n",
       "* **Arcanite Skullcap** - For the mirror to stop Herald of Erudition lol\n",
       "* **Dream Weavers** - Wear this against Brute.\n",
       "* **Ironhide Gauntlet** - The Starvo Special. Ideally save this for a hand with Soul Shield and a blue, but if it saves you from a Crippling Crush or Oaken Old it has done it's job.\n",
       "* **Goliath Gauntlet** - Wear this the rest of the time. Your goal is to use it to ensure Herald of Erudition will hit.\n",
       "* **Celestial Cataclysm** - Only for the mirror to pop phantasm, and against Katsu to maintain tempo.\n",
       "* **Unmovable** - Board this in against Starvo, don't be afraid to use it from hand if it stops an oaken old or Crippling Crush. Also great in the mirror.\n",
       "* **Wartune Herald (Red)** - For matchups where you can't stick auras and need to just kill quickly. Katsu, any Runeblade, Dash, or the mirror. Also strong against Starvo to help keep tempo between his insane turns.\n",
       "* **Parable of Humility** - Must kill aura for go wide decks (Katsu, Briar, Chane, Lexi) and also fantastic against Brutes who run lots of attacks with exactly 6 power.\n",
       "* **Passing Mirage** - In matchups where your opponent doesn't run 6 powers, just playing an aura isn't worth the card slot (but it almost is). Bring in against Brute and Guardian)\n",
       "* **Prismatic Shield** - Only for matchups that are bad at breaking spectras (Guardian, Ranger, Brute, and Dorinthea). Do not bring this and Wartune Herald (Red) in at the same time.\n",
       "* *DISCLAIMER* Don't buy a library of solana, run nullrune boots instead. I just play it because I own one like a clown\n",
       "* **Great Library of Solana** - There are too many blue cards in this deck for this card to be good. If you are desperate to play with your $300 card bring this in against Oldhim, Ice Lexi, Azalea, and Control Dash. If you bring this in against Starvo (or any aggressive deck) the tempo loss will kill you. If your opponent plays yellow cards then you are basically playing this card to help them out.\n",
       "# Matchups\n",
       "* **Starvo** - Wear Ironhide Gauntlets. Bring in Unmovable,  Wartune Herald (Red), and Passing Mirage. This should be a 50/50 matchup (which is as good as it gets against Starvo). Try to stick two auras in one turn (a yellow instant and a blue action), and then apply pressure with heralds. Save cards in soul for the very lategame, or to deny Crush/Oaken triggers. You will not get to keep your spectral shields long, and he can come in with Winter's Wail to take out 1 spectra a turn. \n",
       "* **Runeblade** - Wear Nullrune Gloves. Bring in Wartune Herald (Red), Passing Mirage, and  Parable of Humility. Against Viserai bring in Unmovable instead of Parable.. A bad matchup, made better by our high blue count. Runeblades will pressure your life total and spectral shield count with Runechants and attack actions, and will finish their turn with a Rosetta Thorn to take out a spectral and still get in 2 arcane damage. Two auras a turn can overwhelm, but will leave you vulnerable to aggressive hands. Try Unmovable against Runic Reclamation.\n",
       "* **Prism (Mirror)** - Wear Arcanite Skullcap, Nullrune Gloves can be helpful to deal with Merciful Retribution but overall probably isn't as helpful as Goliath Gauntlet. Bring in Celestial Cataclysm, Unmovable, and Wartune Herald (Red). \n",
       "* **Lexi** - Bring in Prismatic Shield, Parable of Humility, and Passing Mirage. This is basically a free matchup because Lexi cannot kill spectras easily, and cannot keep tempo if they draw any all/no arrow hands. Passing Mirage over Unmovable because Lexi usually boards in 6 powers like Command and Conquer and Battering Bolt. As well, it will just stay in play and help you whittle her down. Be wary, she can apply pressure quickly early and deny you the opportunity to set up, so play defensively and be ready to capitalize off her weak turns due to bad arrow clumps. Remember if she runs out of arrows you win.\n",
       "* **Katsu** - Bring in Parable of Humility, Wartune Herald (Red), and Celestial Cataclysm. A difficult (but certainly winnable) matchup. Try to play two auras in one turn, and swing in with heralds whenever you can. I find its best to block his later attacks than early ones, but if Katsu draws the right hand early he can gain a huge lead and the pressure he applies will overwhelm you. A smart Katsu always saves their second Kodachi for the end of turn to take out a spectra. If they end turn with an action point and a kodachi/card they can still use do not play an aura. You will have a hard time keeping your spectral shields because of his kodachis, so try to conserve the cards in your soul so that you can Celestial Cataclysm. Certainly a very skill intensive matchup.\n",
       "# GUIDE\n",
       "Alright, so I brought this deck to my local ProQuest and came in 3rd. I only play Prism, and I play every day. In my opinion, this is the best Prism list out there. Many players have shifted away from Vestige of Sol and Halo of Illumination (\"Old Prism\") and now use Fyendal's Spring Tunic and Arcanite Skullcap (\"New Prism\"), but I feel this is a mistake. This list leans heavily into the Vestige of Sol by playing several blue heralds, which pitch for 4 with vestige online, enough to play an aura or tome.\n",
       "\n",
       "Matchups: \n",
       "1. **Dorinthea Axes** Free win, ended game at 37 and with 10 spectral shields. I think I have a 100% winrate against Dorinthea lol. They cannot easily remove auras, and they don't run attacks (except sideboard and Nourishing), so they are vulnerable to both auras, and heralds.\n",
       "2. **\"New Prism\"** Close win. In the mirror, Old Prism should beat New Prism because Tome's explosive turns grant too much tempo. This is almost definitely the most skill intensive matchup. Remember to block Herald of Erudition.\n",
       "3. **Aggro Dash** Close win. Aggro Dash aims to win with lots of boosted attacks, so Parable of Humility did a lot of work this game. Blocking with footsteps early, and then again after the chain was closed from reloading granted a strong life point advantage.\n",
       "4. **Starvo** Win. Ended with 13 life still. He didn't hit a Starvo trigger until turn 4, or ever attack with an Oaken Old. I got auras out early, and he couldn't put out too much damage without Starvo triggers. The biggest turn featured a Starvo'd Crippling Crush, where i pitched a blue aura to use Ironhide, Soul Shield, and my two spectral shields to prevent the crush, then pitched a blue herald to play tome of divinity. Game would certainly have been closer if I hadn't gained that tempo back.\n",
       "5. **Viserai** Win. Ended with 15 life. My opponent never played any Runic Reclamations, and seemed to never draw their 6 powers on my herald turns. This is usually a closer matchup, but luck was in my favor. I stuck some key auras early, and my opponent couldn't get the right hand at the right time.\n",
       "6. **Chane** Loss. Only loss in the prelims (making me second seed in the quarterfinals). Opponent ended at 6. This is certainly not a good matchup for prism, as chane can easily ping off spectral shields with many small attacks, and can pick off a spectra at the end of turn. My opponent intelligently used Spellbound creepers multiple times, as a way to gain a second action point and then taking out 2 auras.\n",
       "Quarterfinals. **\"New Prism\"** Win. Ended at 16. I got to go first due to my high seed, and established two auras early. I think my opponent focused too heavily in ending each turn with a blue aura. I started ahead on auras, and would use my final action for the turn to instead attack one of his auras with a token.\n",
       "Semifinals. **Starvo** Loss. Opponent ended the game at 14, and got Starvo to trigger literally every turn (They were on the \"Captain Planet\" build). I also had no auras in my starting hand. Auras are definitely our wincon against Starvo, so it wasn't meant to be. \n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "This deck aims to win the game by lowering your opponent's life total in two ways. The first is Luminaris, letting you chip in small amounts of damage over the course of the game. The second is heralds, large threatening attacks that fuel our soul. Many decks are resistant to one of these strategies but vulnerable to the other, so this deck utilizes both. Having a plan is necessary for Prism, making her a more difficult but rewarding hero than average.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "# Auras\n",
       "\t\t\t\t\n",
       "\n",
       "*  When in control of both types of auras (Spectral Shield tokens and spectra auras), Prism becomes a dominating offensive force. Each aura represents one damage every turn until removed, but dealing with one often means leaving yourself vulnerable to the other. If Prism can establish enough of these auras on the board, she will have the ability to block attacks with up to 3 cards to protect her shields, and then pitch a yellow to swing in with her auras, leading to a swift victory.\n",
       "*    In order to reach this boardstate, you will need to get both types of auras in play. This is not as easy as it sounds. In general you will want to get spectra auras out early, by utilizing \"2 Aura Turns\". A 2 Aura Turn is a turn in which you will play a yellow instant aura (like Genesis) and a blue action aura (like Shimmers of Silver). Because the most spectras any given hero can remove in a turn is 1 (usually), this essentially guarantees that you will still have one of these on your next turn.\n",
       "*    Establishing one spectra aura in play is a serious turning point for prism. Now, every time you attack on your turn you'll get that one extra damage in, and your opponent will be hesitant to block, as they may need their cards to remove the aura. Capitalizing off of this position is key to getting ahead of your opponent, and snowballing to a winning position.\n",
       "*    Every single spectra aura currently available to Prism is in this list, although some are in the sideboard. There are 5 yellow instant auras, and 4 blue action auras, totaling 9. With three copies of each that makes 27 auras. This maxes out our odds of drawing a 2 Aura Hand, at 61.4%. If you are not playing either aura from the sideboard, this means a deck of 21 auras, and only a 43,8% chance to draw a two aura hand.\n",
       "*    Conversely, Spectral Shield tokens are not what you want to focus on early in the game to pressure your opponent. Although Spectral Shields may be more plentiful (and therefore more threatening), they are much more difficult to protect. Instead, it is better to attempt to establish a board of one or multiple spectra auras before prioritizing spectral shields.\n",
       "*    There are two ways to actively create Spectral Shield tokens. You can connect with heralds, fueling Prism's soul so she can turn them into Spectral Shields later down the line. Or you can play Prismatic Shield (Red), a gameswinging card, which creates 3 spectral shields at once. If you have spectra auras in play, this card can end the game quite quickly, adding three damage a turn.\n",
       "*    Prismatic Shield is a devastating card in the late game, but a fairly mediocre card in the early game. This is because your opponent can remove all 3 spectral shields with just one attack if it is too big to completely block, it has dominate, or your hand does not block well.\n",
       "*     For this reason, if you draw one early, it is important to pitch it, so you still have access to it in the late game. However this card is at it's strongest when paired with a blue card. A fantastic early play, is to pitch a Prismatic Shield, and a blue card, in order to play a 4 cost aura. This establishes board presence now, while also guaranteeing you a powerful finisher in the late game.\n",
       "\n",
       "# Heralds\n",
       "*  Heralds are light illusionist attack action cards that have fantastic stats for their cost and go into your soul on hit, but have phantasm, making them useless if blocked by a 6 power or higher card. It is safe to assume that in every single matchup, your opponent will have access to 6 power cards. This is why Phantasmal Footsteps is not optional (except against Kano, who sometimes runs Nourishing Emptiness, but that's it).\n",
       "* In general, Prism is looking to establish auras in play, and only play heralds on turns where that isn't an option. However if you have already established auras, then attacking with a herald, then all your auras is a very threatening turn.\n",
       "*  Knowing when to play your heralds and pressure your opponent's life total, and when to instead pitch/block with your heralds to play or protect auras, is a key part of piloting prism. This decision is heavily dependent on what deck your opponent is playing, life totals, cards in your soul, how many auras you have in play, and other factors as well. This is part of what makes Prism such a skill dependent hero, and why she rewards a knowledgeable player who thinks through each hand carefully, and knows what to prioritize.\n",
       "# Play Patterns\n",
       "Here are some common decisions you will want to make with this deck. It's not easy to memorize them and always use them, instead you will want to figure out why these play patterns are good so they come naturally to you.\n",
       "* If you have a lot of auras out, pitching a yellow card to attack with Wartune Herald/Miraging Metamorph is fantastic. Luminaris gives it go again, and if they pop the phantasm you can use footsteps to regain your point with your 1 spare resource. This applies pressure and allows you to attack with all your auras guaranteed. If you still have your 1 resource left after the auras, maybe you could even attack with another Wartune Herald/Miraging Metamorph.\n",
       "* Finish your opponent off with a herald. If you can use Prism's hero ability to get the yellow in your pitch zone, attack with all your auras, then end with a herald, you can sometimes bait out blocks to make the herald more devastating. This line is strong when you have enough auras that your opponent might think twice about not blocking them. This also prevents the loss of your action point from Phantasm. \n",
       "* Put Tome of Divinity in your arsenal! This card is busted, especially with vestige and our blue heralds. Save this for one of two situations, 1: You draw another Tome. Then you can use your halo of illumination to get the ball rolling. 2: Something goes into your soul incidentally. The key ways are Soul Shield, Merciful Retribution, Genesis, or a herald.\n",
       "# Card Discussion\n",
       "Gonna talk about why some cards are powerful, why some key cards aren't included, and some other cards to consider.\n",
       "* **Vestige of Sol** This is the big difference between this list and other Prism lists. Many Prisms wear Skullcap against Starvo, and then are turned away from Vestige because it's harder to abuse without Halo. However, in my findings, the benefits of Vestige and Halo outweigh the benefits of Skullcap and Tunic. Crazy Tome of Divinity turns really help in the Starvo matchup, and many players are sacrificing that to try to play defensively against Starvo's crazy high damage output. While using Skullcap to prevent an Oaken Old trigger is powerful, it doesn't set you ahead in the way that Halo and Tome does. Beating Starvo is all about establishing auras and maintaining tempo. Skullcap will help prevent a loss of tempo but Tome will allow you to gain tremendous tempo.\n",
       "* **Great Library of Solana** This card is incredibly powerful, just not in this deck, or in this meta. If you draw this card, you cannot pitch it, and you cannot block with it. This means you HAVE to play it (or put it in your soul with halo). Drawing this card on a turn where you need to block is bad. Drawing it on a turn where you don't have two yellows is bad. And even if you pitch two yellows to play a herald and a library, you can't follow up with a blue aura, you might not be able to pitch two yellows next turn, and you lost tempo playing this instead of an aura/herald. Not currently meta viable.\n",
       "* **Herald of Judgement** Probably the card I have considered including in the sideboard the hardest. On paper it seems great: A yellow herald that counters Chane and Katsu, two bad matchups for us. However in practice it usually doesn't work that well. If it really would screw over their turn, they will pop Phantasm (so we traded two cards for one card) or will block with two cards (so we traded two for two). Either way we don't gain much. The deck needs yellow heralds though, and I have considered mainboarding this over yellow Herald of Rebirth. If you find you are facing a lot of Chane and Katsu's (or even Kano lol), then consider this card. Very meta dependent.\n",
       "* **Phantasmaclasm** For a little while I ran this in the sideboard over Unmovable to counter Starvo. Attack with it, put the Pulse in their hand on the bottom and deny them the Starvo trigger. The problem is this card is too clunky, and just not as consistent as Unmovable. They can easily pop phantasm, 3 cost requires pitching two yellows (except in rare circumstances), and they might just have a hand that you can't disrupt. As well, Unmovable is also a powerful option in the mirror, where Phantasmaclasm is not. If aggro Prism ever makes a comeback keep your eye on this card.\n",
       "* **Fractal Replication** I wanted this card to be good, but outside of a hyper aggro Prism deck, this card is terrible. It can't attack or block alone, it can't copy your heralds if they hit (because they go to the soul), and it is a red card, which ruins aura hands. This card is playable in blitz with Phantasmaclasm and Dream Weavers, but I don't think it has a home in constructed.\n",
       "# Closing Statements\n",
       "I have more to say about Prism but this guide is already more than 3000 words so I'm gonna publish it now. I plan on expanding on this guide in the future. In my experience other Prism decklists and guides will run questionable cards without justification, and don't ever dive deep into Prism's unique gameplans and card choices. If you have a question, or enjoyed this guide please leave a comment so I know I'm doing this for anyone other than myself. I absolutely will read and reply to every comment and I love talking about Prism, teaching, and learning."
